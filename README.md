# The script is a simple shell script that creates a new GitHub repository with a README.md file. It uses the GitHub CLI to create the repository and push the local repository to the remote repository. 
 
# The script takes the repository name as an argument or prompts the user to enter the repository name. It then creates a README.md file with the repository name, initializes a local git repository, and creates a GitHub repository using the GitHub CLI. 

# The script then sets up the remote URL for the git repository and pushes the local repository to the remote repository. 

# To use the script, save it to a file (e.g., newGhRepo.sh) and make it executable by running: 
chmod +x newGhRepo.sh

# Then, you can run the script with the repository name as an argument: 
 ./newGhRepo.sh my-new-repo
 
# The script will create a new GitHub repository with the name my-new-repo and push the local repository to the remote repository. 

# You can also set the GITHUB_USERNAME and GITHUB_TOKEN variables in the script if you don't have them set in the environment. 

# Conclusion 
# In this article, we have explored how to create a new GitHub repository using the GitHub CLI and a shell script. We have seen how to use the GitHub CLI to create a new repository, set up a local git repository, and push the local repository to the remote repository. 

# By using the GitHub CLI and a shell script, you can automate the process of creating new GitHub repositories and save time when setting up new projects.
